1.  Get a Handle to a SharedPreferences
    getSharedPreferences()
        — Use this if you need multiple shared preference files identified by name,
        which you specify with the first parameter. You can call this from any Context in your app.
    getPreferences()
        — Use this from an Activity if you need to use only one shared preference file for the activity.
        Because this retrieves a default shared preference file that belongs to the activity,
        you don't need to supply a name.
